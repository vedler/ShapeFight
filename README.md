# ShapeFight

Shape Fight is a classic 2D run-and-gun multiplayer platformer, where you control a shape of your choosing equipped with a variety of weapons and/or skills. The shape is equipped with a jetpack that allows the shape to fly for a short duration until its fuel runs out and has to be regenerated.

While the controls and mechanics such as jetpacks, wall jumping and different weapons are simple and easy to understand, the game has a high skill ceiling, making the game suitable for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. The large selection of weapons and skills the player can choose from can lead to all sorts of spectacular combos, making every match an unique experience.
